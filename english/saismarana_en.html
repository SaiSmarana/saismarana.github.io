                                    confusion surfaces over my subconscious mind screen..
                                    Asper Sai thatwa.. we are not supposed to plan & decide things on our own. We should
                                    leave the whole script of play at Baba"s descretion. Okay, agreed. Sounds good. üëç
                                    Ofcourse , in the cases of Amir shakkar, BabuTendulkar, Balram mankad, Europian
                                    officer, Damu Anna Cotton trading..and many more cases, it got prooved to be right.
                                    Means,.. do we need to understand that those who want to be 100% under Sai 's radar
                                    > üì° what they really plan, it doesn't workout ...only it materialises asper the
                                    Sai"s plan and wish. Sometimes in the
                                    totally opposite the way what you expected.
                                    If so, how we need to adapt this theory in our day to day worldly life ? Should we
                                    plan things by our own or not ? Or don't run after planning things but simply just
                                    sit calm and wait for the things happen at Baba"s will n wish ?
                                    How to improvise this theory in our worldly life ?
                                    Plz take your own free time and clarify sir..üôè

                                Dear Durgaprasad Garu, pranams! Sorry, for the late reply‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt focus due to some
                                personal busy ‚Ä¶. You expressed such a kind of confusion which is the common doubt of
                                many devotees ‚Ä¶
                                I believe, one way it is the toughest question and of course, in another way, it is the
                                easiest as well ‚Ä¶depending upon the state of mind of the devotees, ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
                                this subject is taken up in detail‚Ä¶ in our book ‚Äú SRADDHA-SABURI‚Äù in the 3 rd part of
                                the book‚Ä¶ I.e.. falling in love ( first stage ),
                                being in love ( second stage) and being love ( 3rd stage)‚Ä¶..in first and second stages
                                ‚Ä¶. a devotee thinks in terms of his personal and family aspirations and difficulties‚Ä¶..
                                like desiring something and overcoming some difficulties‚Ä¶ overall bottom line is making
                                life comfortable.. which, obviously requires some planning & this is where and
                                how devotee seeks God‚Äôs help‚Ä¶.in these cases success normally depends upon one‚Äôs
                                destiny‚Ä¶but in the case of those devotees who are tied with a divine RUNANUBANDHA with
                                Sadguru ‚Ä¶ sometimes
                                Sadguru stands by the devotee & makes things to go in a way that devotee likes to be‚Ä¶but
                                here we must note the point ‚Ä¶.Sadguru does it because to take the devotee to further
                                stage‚Ä¶.
                                Here the most important point that we understand is ‚Ä¶. the role of Sadguru is to make
                                devotee to get rid of all his Karmic backlogs‚Ä¶
                                during this process ‚Ä¶.sometimes Sadguru allows things to take place according to the
                                destiny‚Ä¶ so that some backlog gets diminished‚Ä¶ during this period devotee - in worldly
                                view - suffers a lot but not in the view of Sadguru‚Ä¶
                                this is where a devotee feels that Sadguru is not gracing him ‚Ä¶ but the fact is ‚Äúthe
                                Sadguru never stops gracing the devotee ‚Äú‚Ä¶
                                only thing is here that the Sadguru is not gracing the way devotee likes .. that is only
                                the difference‚Ä¶
                                but a devotee who is strongly bound to Sadguru, by and by understands this fact and
                                mechanism ‚Ä¶that means he reaches the third stage I.e becomes ‚Äú being love ‚Äú
                                where he does not wish anything except devotion to Sadguru & so he doesn‚Äôt plan anything
                                and opens for Sadguru‚Äôs wish to take place‚Ä¶overall what we have to understand is ‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a
                                process ‚Ä¶
                                till we reach that stage ‚Ä¶ as per our human needs & tendencies we keep planning‚Ä¶but
                                results take place
                                as per the wish of our beloved Sadguru‚Ä¶. The last but not the least point is Sadguru‚Äôs
                                grace cannot be the parameter of one‚Äôs worldly wealth and health‚Ä¶. Svasti üôè
